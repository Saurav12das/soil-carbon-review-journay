Dear Dr Das,

Thank you for your recent correspondence about our decision to decline publication of your manuscript.

In order to initiate an appeal, we must ask that you submit a revised manuscript together with a point-by-point response to the reviewers' comments from the most recent round of review. Please also include a brief letter to explain why you feel your manuscript warrants further consideration in Communications Earth & Environment; this would not be available to the reviewers should we decide to seek further advice from them.

Specifically, based on reviewer comments, we strongly recommend that you:
-rigorously examine the limitations of soil carbon sequestration
-thoroughly examine aspects of soil and agricultural management
-ensure you reflect the most recent relevant literature in your citations.

Please use the following link to resubmit the above files:
https://mts-commsenv.nature.com/cgi-bin/main.plex?el=A1DE3DDU5B2WBW6I1B9ftdwK6i21WZEkJt7wA1dfYhwZ

Once we receive these items, the editorial team, including an editorial board member and internal editor(s), will be able to discuss whether it is in your best interest for us to proceed further.

We will inform you of our decision as soon as possible. However, because Communications Earth & Environment is committed to providing streamlined peer review and rapid publication, I'm afraid we must give priority to new and current submissions. Therefore I apologize if there is a delay in our response.

Best regards,
