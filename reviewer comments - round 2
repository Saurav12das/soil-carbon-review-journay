"Reviewers' comments:



Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author):

The authors have effectively addressed all of my concerns regarding the revised manuscript. Consequently, I have no additional comments to provide at this time.





Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author):

While I like the general idea of presenting a short review on the limitations of C sequestration processes, the aspects of soil and agricultural management remain premature. I agree that it is not possible to do so in a few pages, but then I think the authors should rather relate to existing reviews, published in Science and the Nature journals (and sometimes GCB, Ambio, Geoderma), the former partly with several letters to the editors, and to summarize these key findings rather than just listing a few aspects of relevance. The whole discussion ignores the need to maintain yield, to interact with biodiversity, to maintain the water balance etc.



In case the paper is published I urgently recommend the authors to revisit the existing literature since 2016, to follow critical discussions outlined in the above-mentioned journals already, and maybe list all limitations from the bunch of reviews available in a Table rather than just mentioning a few correct but incomplete aspects of soil C sequestration





Reviewer #3 (Remarks to the Author):

Authors have revised the paper well. I have no further comments."
