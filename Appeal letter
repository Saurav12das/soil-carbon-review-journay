Dear Dr. X,
I sincerely appreciate the time and effort you and the reviewers have dedicated to evaluating our manuscript, "Soil Carbon Sequestration: A Mechanistic Perspective on Limitations and Future Possibilities." While I respect the editorial decision, I would like to request reconsideration based on the following points.
Our manuscript explicitly states in the Introduction that it is not focused on management practices but rather provides a mechanistic perspective on soil carbon sequestration, integrating soil chemistry, physics, and biology. We carefully revised the manuscript to address all primary concerns raised by the reviewers, and notably, Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 3 expressed no further concerns and were satisfied with our responses.
Regarding Reviewer 2’s comments, we provided a detailed response to their previous queries, including those related to stoichiometry and soil carbon sequestration processes. However, their latest comments indicate an expectation that our paper should engage extensively with management aspects and policy discussions, which is beyond the stated scope of our work.
Additionally, Reviewer 2’s statement regarding revisiting the literature "in case the paper is published" raises concerns, as it suggests a conditional evaluation rather than an objective assessment of the revised manuscript itself. Since peer review is intended to determine whether a manuscript meets the journal’s standards in its current form, rather than anticipate potential future revisions post-publication, this phrasing indicates an unclear basis for rejection.
Given that two reviewers had no further concerns, I would appreciate clarification on whether the decision was made based on an overall editorial assessment or whether it was heavily influenced by one reviewer's specific expectations that may not fully align with the manuscript’s scope. If possible, we kindly request reconsideration of our manuscript for further review.
I have attached the previous decision email and reviewer comments for reference. Thank you for your time and consideration—I look forward to your response.
Respectfully,
Saurav
