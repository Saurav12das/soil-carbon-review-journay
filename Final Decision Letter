Dear Dr Das,

Thank you for your letter asking us to reconsider our decision on your manuscript entitled "Soil Carbon Sequestration: A Mechanistic Perspective on Limitations and Future Possibilities". Now that I have had the chance to discuss the matter with my colleagues, I am sorry to have to tell you that we cannot reverse our earlier decision.

We always consider the views of authors who feel that their work has been misjudged at an editorial level. However, our decisions are made after careful thought regarding what a paper in Communications Earth & Environment should achieve. So in general we can reconsider our position only if it becomes clear that we have overlooked specific scientific issues relating to the work in question, or when implications are pointed out to us that were not already apparent from the manuscript itself.

In this case, we appreciate the points you raise, and are not questioning the validity of your work or its interest to others who work on the same problem. However, our view remains that your manuscript will not be of sufficient interest to our readers to justify its publication in Communications Earth & Environment. We are sorry that, on this occasion, we cannot be more positive and hope you will not be deterred from submitting future work to Communications Earth & Environment.

Best regards,
