REVIEWER COMMENTS:

Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author):

This review focuses on soil carbon sequestration, a critically important issue in climate change mitigation. The article examines various limiting factors affecting soil carbon sequestration, including plant physiology, root structure, microbial interactions, and environmental influences. It also addresses human dimensions, which are essential for a comprehensive understanding of soil carbon cycles. In addition to reviewing existing knowledge, the article discusses innovative strategies to enhance soil carbon sequestration, such as photosynthetic modifications, root system engineering, microbial bioengineering, and the use of advanced materials. The well-structured and logically organized, which aids readers in grasping the concepts, progressing from introductory material to limitation analysis, future possibilities, and management considerations. However, the article requires revision before it can be accepted for publication. Here are some suggestions for improvement:
1. Soil carbon saturation is critical for evaluating and projecting soil carbon sequestration potential. While the author mentions this concept, it would be beneficial to present research progress on how to determine when soil is carbon saturated, the main factors influencing soil carbon saturation, and the current global levels of soil carbon saturation.
2. The physiological characteristics of plants, carbon allocation, and root traits significantly influence carbon input into the soil. Additionally, the mechanisms that maintain community-level vegetation productivity, particularly the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning, are crucial. Numerous studies have shown that communities with high biodiversity enhance productivity and soil carbon storage, making ecosystem management a highly effective strategy for improving carbon stocks and mitigating climate change.
3. The chemical properties of soil, particularly the formation of metal-soil organic carbon (SOC) complexes, are vital for the long-term stabilization of the soil carbon pool. While the role of iron and aluminum oxides in protecting SOC is well-established, recent studies indicate that calcium ions may also play a protective role in alkaline soils. The authors should supplement this section to fully reflect the contributions of various metal ions to soil organic carbon protection.
4. Recent research has highlighted the importance of phytolith carbon in maintaining the stability of soil carbon pools. As a significant component of the stable soil carbon pool, phytolith carbon is crucial for enhancing soil carbon sinks and maintaining the global carbon balance. Some studies suggest that phytolith carbon accumulation may contribute approximately 20% of the global average accumulation rate of soil organic carbon, warranting inclusion in the discussion.
5. Biological soil crusts play a significant role in maintaining the stability of soil carbon pools, particularly in dryland ecosystems. They enhance soil organic carbon content, improve soil physical and chemical properties, increase soil enzyme activity, and regulate soil carbon cycles. It is essential to present recent research on the impacts of soil crusts on soil carbon stability.
6. In the section titled “Management and Human Dimensions,” it is important to include the positive effects of restoring and managing degraded ecosystems on soil carbon storage.
7. Detailed Comments:
• Line 137: Correct "COf" to "CO2."
• Line 263: Remove the extra “%.”
• Line 337: Emphasize that precipitation is a more significant factor than photosynthesis in dominating the seasonal and inter-annual variability of soil moisture.
• Figure 1: Add the pathway of plant autotrophic respiration and clarify the carbon input pathways from both above- and below-ground litter (currently, only rhizodeposition is shown).



Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author):

This paper nicely summarizes main processes of the soil C cycle and introduces several novel options how to maximize C input. While this is certainly helpful for teaching, it, unfortunately, remains for a scientific review quite general. Nearly all of the information provided until line 510 is well known, and repeats information from rather old reviews, e.g. of vonLützow et al., 2006 or 2007, Soil Biol Biochem. Also the numbers do not seem up to date with, e.g., Friedlingstein et al., 2023, ESSD, while other important processes like stoichiometric controls and nutrient mining in C dynamics are lacking. The later sections add new avenues, such as to modify plants, or expressing the deep rooting genes. But also here, the information remains fairly general and is partly found in other reviews (e.g., Paustian et al.,2016). Besides,the authros do hardly sapecify the success of the different measures in different environments, for different biomes, climatic regimes, soils, and management practices. I am therefore afraid that the whole paper is, at given level of detail, not providing sufficient novel inforamtion for the broad readership of CEE



Reviewer #3 (Remarks to the Author):

Authors review limitations on soil carbon sequestration and also summarize emerging and innovative ideas to increase soil C sequestration. I found the latter (section 3) to be much more interesting and useful than the former (section 2) part of the review. This is because section 2 presents a lot of basic information and repeats information across multiple subsections (see some examples in my comments below; not an exhaustive list). My major comment for this review is to significantly reduce the amount of text in section 2, perhaps only giving a quick overview of the limitations as they tie to the review in section 3. And make section 3 the larger focus of the review as it is the more novel part.

Minor comments (mostly focused on section 2 and also on improving referencing sections 1 and 2).

L 51-53: not sure if reference#1 is the most up to date reference for these statements? Consider updating with IPCC or other more recent estimates?

L54-57: these sentences require references and/or make them less assertive. For example, soil MAY offer a natural and effective means of reducing atmospheric co2…

L57-59: consider referring to global carbon budget papers and not soil papers to support this statement

L103: I would flip the order of these last two sentences

L129: ref#23 is not the best one for defining priming. How about the following or references within:
https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.17082

L209: ref 45 and 46 aren’t the most appropriate ones for these. Various papers and syntheses exist where authors have investigated the amount of root-derived C in soils, often using C isotopes. Those would be more suited here. For example you bring some of these up in line 253. Also, why repeat this information in two places.

L 228: why bring up priming again in a root architecture section? Priming was already discussed in the previous section? Priming is also repeated on line 261

Section 2.3 heading: change to “Structural and physical soil characteristics” otherwise it’s unclear what this refers to.
